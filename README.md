Audiokinetic Wwise RIFF/RIFX Vorbis to Ogg Vorbis converter by hcs

Documentation to come eventually?

Note: AudioKinetic Wwise 2011.2 starts using a new set of packed codebooks.
If you are getting totally invalid files as output, for a game produced after
mid-2011, try using the --pcb packed_codebooks_aoTuV_603.bin switch.

Note 2: It is a good idea to run the output through revorb to get smaller,
cleaner files than ww2ogg generates currently.
